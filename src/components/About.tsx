      <p>I am someone that always learning. Cliche, I know, but I wanted to build a web application with technologies I've never used before</p>
      <p>In order to develop this web app, I learned and integrated Typescript, React Hooks, Context API, SASS, on the Frontend</p>
      <p>On the backend, I learned Python, Flask, SASS, and deployed it on AWS!</p>
      <p>I would love to learn more! In fact, my next plan would be to implement GraphQL!</p>
